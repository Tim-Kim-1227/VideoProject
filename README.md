<b>Project Name: An Ocean in a Drop</b>

<b>Project Description:</b>

The film we selected to make revolves around the concept of loneliness as it is represented on the NYUAD campus. Loneliness, despair, and homesickness are common sentiments among students. We want to emphasize this because the campus is constantly buzzing with events, parties, and gatherings, and no one really pays attention to the silent intervals between everything, much alone read the lines between the silence. This project aims to make students feel seen, heard, and know that they are not alone in this experience. Different emotions may arise while watching the film, and all feelings are welcome. The film's monologue attempts to capture the many voices inside someone's head as they navigate life on campus with the heavy burden of loneliness. We've seen many friends or classmates lock themselves in their dorm rooms and let all the negativity in. As a result, the repeated emphasis on "four walls, one room, one lock.‚Äù With this project, we hope to raise the student body's awareness of their peers' situations. This fosters empathy and understanding among the students.

<b>Process:</b>

As soon as we finalized the concept, we prepared what we needed before filming including the place, actor, and equipment. One of our colleagues let our team use his dorm and we were able to find our actor soon after. Thanks to the help from others, our team was able to concentrate on shooting and directing the film. Due to our lack of experience in shooting videos with professional equipment, filming was the most difficult part for us. Since we wanted the film to have a depressing tone, we went through several trials-and-errors to find an appropriate lighting of the environment and camera setting before filming each scene. Once the lighting of the environment was set, filming the scenes was very enjoyable. Actor has done an outstanding job and our videos came out great. Our film was edited using Adobe Premiere Pro. One challenge I confronted in editing the video was the presence of background noise in the video sound; for this reason, I have removed audios from the footage and added appropriate sound effects like recordists would do. I think this highlighted the contrast between the silence and the sound, which added up to the general atmosphere of the film.
